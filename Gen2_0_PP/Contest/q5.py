James Bond Collects the consecutive codes (only of length 7).By consecutive we mean that we can collect them one after another.He is able to move in the four directions: North, South, West and East.

Input Format

Input starts with an integer T, representing the number of test cases (1<=T<=20). Each test case consists of a matrix, described as follows:

An integer N (1<=N<=8), representing the side length of the square-shaped matrix. N lines follow, N characters each. A 'X' character represents an James Code, and a '.' represents a Fake Code.

Constraints

1<=T<=20

1<=N<=8
